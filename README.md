# VLMs have Tunnel Vision

This repository hosts the source for the project website accompanying the paper
[VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
by Shmuel Berman and Jia Deng (Princeton University, NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight).

The site showcases three diagnostic tasks—Object Re-Identification, Visual Scavenger Hunt, and
Circuit Connections—and includes interactive demos, dataset descriptions, and results.

This project is adapted from the excellent [Nerfies website template](https://nerfies.github.io).
