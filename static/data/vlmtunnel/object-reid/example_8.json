For example, if a component shape were to be rotated or translated separately from the entire composite-object, it would be a different object. Respond with {yes} or {no} (inside the curly brackets). There may be extra shapes in Image 2 that are not part of the original object; as long as the object from Image 1 is present, the answer is yes even if there are other shapes present."
